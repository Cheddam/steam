# PHP Steam API Wrapper

This is a thin layer over the Steam API (data, not authentication). So far, it covers:

- ISteamApps: Retrieving all apps (games, etc) on Steam, and querying for Steam servers on an IP address
- ISteamNews: News relating to apps (games, etc).

Planned for cover shortly:

- ISteamUser: Friend lists, groups, and general profile data.
- ISteamUserStats: User achievements and other statistics.
- IPlayerService: User game lists / details.
